#How would you describe your knowledge of Linux?
Advanced to Expert
I am very well versed and have many years of experience with all different flavors/distros of both Linux and Unix. I chose Advanced to Expert, and not just Expert, because I don't recall every detail from memory and sometimes refer to my notes.


#How would you describe your knowledge of Windows?
Intermediate
I have worked with plenty of Windows machines, but it has never been my primary responsibility as an engineer.


#How would you describe your knowledge of MacOS?
Basic
I've never 'worked' on MacOS machines, but I have basic knowledge in the sense that I've always performed my work on Mac hardware and, given MacOS and Linux similarities, can leverage my Linux expertise to navigate MacOS. 


#How would you describe your ability to work with the command-line?
Advanced to Expert
Similar to the first questions regarding Linux, nearly my entire professional career I've spent a large majority of my time on the command line, but I do still refer to my notes or rely on Google here and there when I get stuck , hence why I did not pick strictly 'Expert.'


#What is your operating system of choice to work with the command-line?
Linux


#How would you describe your level of scripting/programming ability?
Basic to Intermediate
I've written plenty of shell scripts in my time at General Motors as a Linux Admin and then Engineer, but haven't done a ton of shell scripting in my new role outside of small personal automations.
I've taking various trainings on coding, including Codecademy's Python3 course.
I've got production code in our environment here at Salesforce, some basic stuff that I wrote alone, and some very advanced stuff that I wrote/co-authored in cooperation with more experienced programmers.


#Do you consider yourself someone who writes scripts or programs/codes?
Yes and no. I've done this plenty of times in highly available, highly distributed environments at two Fortune500 companies, but I don't consider myself as someone who's daily role is to script or program/code. That said, I am looking for the opportunity to develop this skill further in my next role.


#Language of choice?
Python
 

#Explain file permission in Linux. 


 
#Given a file, write a command sequence in Linux to find the count of each word. (hint - we are not looking for a simple word count of the whole file, rather how many times each word occurs)

 

#What do you do when someone tells you x is slow on a host?


#If you were designing a new web application environment from the ground up, what kind(s) of hardware, OS, applications, storage, network, etc. would you use, and why?


#Please describe a systems maintenance or operations workflow that you automated?
#What problem did this solve?
#What programming languages or tools did you use?
#What was the outcome?
